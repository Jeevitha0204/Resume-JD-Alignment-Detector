# Fake Resume and Job Description Alignment Detector using LLMs

This project uses **Language Models and Embedding-based Similarity** to evaluate how well a resume aligns with a job description (JD). It helps detect fake, exaggerated, or irrelevant resumes in hiring pipelines.

> Built using `sentence-transformers`, `scikit-learn`, and `Gradio`, and deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**.


## Live Demo
[Click here to try the app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jeevitha-app/Resume-JD-Aligner-Detector-App)  

## Features

-  Detects semantic alignment between Resume and Job Description
-  Uses LLM-based embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
-  Shows a **similarity score** (0â€“100%) with interpretation
-  Flags irrelevant or potentially fake resumes
-  User-friendly interface built with Gradio
-  One-click deployment using Hugging Face Spaces

## How It Works

1. **Input**: User pastes Resume and Job Description text.
2. **Embedding**: Text is converted to numerical embeddings using `SentenceTransformer`.
3. **Similarity**: Cosine similarity is computed between the two embeddings.
4. **Output**: 
   - A score (e.g., 85%)
   - Text feedback:
     - Highly aligned
     -  Partially aligned
     -  Not aligned (possibly fake)
